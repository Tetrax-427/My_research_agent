# 🧠 Autonomous AI Research Agent

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to build an **Autonomous AI Agent** capable of taking a research question as input, autonomously searching for relevant academic content (papers, web sources), extracting insights, and generating concise summaries.

It demonstrates advanced capabilities in **tool use, agent orchestration, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and multi-step reasoning**.

## 🚀 What the Project Does

- Accepts a user-defined **research question**
- Uses open APIs (e.g., **arXiv**, **Semantic Scholar**) and **web search tools** to gather relevant information
- Parses and processes academic papers, extracting key points and insights
- Summarizes findings into human-readable, structured answers
- Integrates multiple autonomous agents for reasoning, search, summarization, and memory

## 🎯 What I Want to Do

- Implement a modular agent framework using **LangGraph** or **Autogen**
- Integrate **RAG pipelines** with vector databases (e.g., **FAISS**, **ChromaDB**)
- Support multiple backends using **open-weight LLMs** (e.g., **Mixtral**, **LLaMA 3**)
- Build an intuitive CLI or web interface
- Add citation tracking and result validation mechanisms

## 🧪 Example Use Case

> **Research Question**: _"What are the latest advancements in retrieval-augmented generation for medical NLP?"_

Output:
- List of top 5 relevant papers with short summaries
- Structured insights (e.g., methods, datasets, benchmarks)
- Citations and links to full texts
